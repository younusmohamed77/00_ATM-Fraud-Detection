# ATM-Fraud-Detection
ATM Fraud Detection ML using Pycaret - advanced ML using GPU 
Compared various ML models and found the fastest model to Random Forest Classifier Model.

**Problem Statement:** PredCatch Analytics' Australian banking client's profitability and reputation are being hit by fraudulent ATM transactions. They want PredCatch to help them in reducing and if possible completely eliminating such fraudulent transactions. PredCatch believes it can do the same by building a predictive model to catch such fraudulent transactions in real time and decline them. Your job as PredCatch's Data Scientist is to build this fraud detection & prevention predictive model in the first step. If successful, in the 2nd step you will have to present your solutions and explain how it works to the client. The data has been made available to you. 
The challenging part of the problem is that the data contains very few fraud instances in comparison to the overall population. To give more edge to the solution they have also collected data regarding location [geo_scores] of the transactions, their own proprietary index [Lambda_wts], on network turn around times [Qset_tats] and vulnerability qualification score [instance_scores]. As of now you don't need to understand what they mean.
Training data contains masked variables pertaining to each transaction id . Your prediction target here is 'Target' .
1: Fraudulent transactions
0: Clean transactions
